# Machine-Learning-Common-Algorithm-Implementations
This is a practice and a tutorial- alike repo to share some of my implementations of most common ML algorithms purely using Numpy

This repo would contains most shallow machine learning algorithm, ranging from GMM with EM, Kmeans, KNN, LogisticRegression derived by maximum likelihood (optimized using gradient descent), Ridge Regression using normal equation.
