# Machine-Learning-Common-Algorithm-Implementations
This is a practice and a tutorial- alike repo to share some of my implementations of most common ML algorithms purely using Numpy

This repo would contains most shallow machine learning algorithm, ranging from GMM with EM, Kmeans, KNN, LogisticRegression derived by maximum likelihood (optimized using gradient descent), Ridge Regression using normal equation.

## Folder linearModel one would be able to find RidgeRegression and Logistic Regression:
- Below shows the performance of the SVM with Norm2 Regularization

- Below shows the performance of the Logistic Regression

- Below shows the performance of the high- dimensional Ridge Regression

## Folder **Clustering** one would be able to find 3 major clustering algorithms: GMM, Kmeans, KNN.
